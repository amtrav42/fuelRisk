# Fuel Risk Calculator
Digitisation of the Overall fuel hazard assessment guide as found here:
https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/21110/Report-82-overall-fuel-assess-guide-4th-ed.pdf

The aim of this project is to make calculating Fuel Hazard a simple and smooth process. 

Initial work plan:

- Create a HTML form set up to take the relevant inputs
- Develop the JS to allow collection and analysis of those inputs
- Style with Sass to make using the form easier (images for buttons etc)

Futher potential:

- Add other relevant forms, eg. CFA fire prep
- Create a backend to collect the data and collate (eg. by postcode)
- Allow for photo upload for confirmation

Even further:

- Use ML to analyse images to calculate Fuel Hazard
